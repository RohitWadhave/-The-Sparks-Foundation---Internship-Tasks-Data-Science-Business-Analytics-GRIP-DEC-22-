# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML

Data Science and Business Analytics Task-2:

1.Predict the optimum number of clusters and the species in 'Iris dataset to be formed with Kmeans & represent it visually.

It is required to form different clusters of the data points.

The task has to be done by using the K-Means unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
We performed K_means Clustering using Elbow Method

Pandas, matplotlib and NumPy libraries are used. Kmeans clustering is used for predicting optimum number of clusters.

Tool(s) Used - Python (Jupyter Notebook)
